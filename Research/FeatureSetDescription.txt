##### High Level Description of Feature Set

> The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. 
> An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization.
> Other bond inclusion rules exist, such as time to maturity, fixed vs. floating coupons, etc. but our primary concern is the rating for the indices.
> Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads would be preferred as they more accurately capture and target the credit risk of a bond, but this data is extremely expensive to source
> Given this constraint, the following ICE BofA OAS indices were used as a proxy for the feature set data
> All data was obtained using the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API
> Additional criteria are also used for bond inclusion within the respective index (time to maturity, coupon structure, outstanding notional, etc.), however only a brief describtion relating the
  rating differences between the indices has been presented below.
